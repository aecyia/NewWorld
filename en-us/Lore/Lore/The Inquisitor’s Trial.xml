<string key="InquisitorTrial_Body_01_01">Forthwith, let it be known, \nBy blood, by wind, and by stone, \nThat we find the defendant, Thaddeus Mayhew, guilty on all charges. \n\nIn his tenure as self-proclaimed Inquisitor General, he has committed harassments, torture, murder, false witness, and a litany of crimes too long to tally in this document. And though these crimes be committed in the Old World, Thaddeus Mayhew shall know no protective limits of time and distance. \n\nWhat the Old World hath permitted, let the New World punish! \n\nWe mark Thaddeus Mayhew with the invisible Sign of Anathema. May all who meet him, friend or stranger, offer him nothing but disgust and personal violence. May he find no succor nor respite. May his body and soul whittle down till he is naught but one of the Lost. May the gods have pity on Thaddeus Mayhew, for no mortal shall. \n\nWe bear witness to this sentence, we the conjurers, healers, and cunning folk condemned in the Old World. Let our wrath be known in the New. \n\n-THE BROKEN COVENANT</string>
