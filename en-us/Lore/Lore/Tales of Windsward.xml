<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_AnUntouchedPiano">An Untouched Piano</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AnUntouchedPiano">January 3. I find myself sitting at the piano more of late, yet my fingers do not touch the keys. Of all the items I salvaged from the wreckage, it has withstood time's erosion where all else in my life has not. In burying Genevieve and Simon, I felt as if I buried a part of myself – there is nothing to strive for, nothing more the island holds for me. Even the presence of the nearby outpost I find grating – the incessant traffic of merchant and animals back and forth on the roads, carving up and dividing what they can dig and pluck from the isle.\n\nThere must be more, something else I may focus upon. I fear that I will live here forever, aimless. I do not know why the isle did not awaken my wife, my son as it did so many others. Perhaps they had tired of life here. Tired of me, and saw no future in it.\n\nI may never know. But I know this – if I do not steady my racing thoughts, I may try to find the same path as they.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_02">Departure</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_Departure">Departure</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Departure">January 17. I had a curious visitor a few days ago - a Frenchwoman M. Cartier, a tanner of buffalo - but more of the look of a hunter about her, oddly enough. She had heard of me and the piano, and sought me out to see it for herself. She seemed surprised by my disposition, but did not inquire deeply about it. I sensed she had lost someone, yet is at peace with it. Quite uncharacteristic of me, I asked her how she had come to cope.\n\nShe said that the isle itself awoke her. Some saw it as a hell, a curse, purgatory – some as a paradise, but that no one truly knew it at all. It was life, she said, and the isle gave birth to all manner of wonders to feed our curiosity. “We were not the first here,” she told me. “Others were here, you can see it in the ruins to the north, the Great Spheres upon the plains. This was a city once, all around us.”\n\nI inquired what happened to this city, and the people before us. She smiled and said, “M. Grenville, perhaps you were brought here to answer that question.”\n\nI gave her words much thought over the past few days. I will seek out these structures and what sense can be made of them – it is better than remaining here and letting more dust gather upon the piano keys.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_03">Rolfe</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_Rolfe">Rolfe</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Rolfe">Feb 24. I have secured a guide, a fellow named Rolfe. Unlike the others, seemed undaunted by the tales of obelisks, spheres – even the dead amongst the ruins on the ridge. “They's dead, no life left in them,” he said. “Guarding nothing, Yorick's all.” He told me that you might chance across one of them in the underbrush while hunting, usually near the great stone structures of the isle, like the lighthouse to the south. I asked if he was not curious about them, and he shrugged – and said if I was, and I had coin or azoth to pay him with, then my curiosity was his gain. “Who cares who built them as long as they're naught more than skeletons now – dead and gone is how I prefer, and I'd rather not join them.”\n\nI told him my interest lay with the Spheres... and perhaps this curious temple he mentioned to the east.\n\nR. Grenville</string>

<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_TheDigSite">The Dig Site: Day 1</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheDigSite">April 1. Rolfe's guidance proved true. The man brought us to one of the Great Spheres, and said here we might labor without interruption. He also introduced me to a former quartermaster of the E. Stokes company, a stern woman by the name of “Maddie” (Madelaine), who leads a crew of a dozen laborers in need of employment (The Stokes Company came to an unfortunate end when their compound was torched by rivals). She seemed not bitter by the experience, only matter-of-fact, and had no wish to build more walls to be burned down.\n\nThe Sphere is partially buried as the others and requires men to dig, but Maddie assured us her crew would put their backs to it if they knew what was good for them – and I had the coin to pay them. I assured them I did. The lie tasted sour in my mouth, but I will figure out a means to pay them – the work on the Great Sphere must begin in the meantime.\n\nR. Grenville</string>

<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_Excavation">Excavation: Day 15</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Excavation">April 15. The work goes swiftly. We have carried away the soil from beneath the Great Sphere, revealing the full mark carved upon the stone.\n\nMaddie's men labor honest and industrious – they work efficiently, which is well and good, as I am not certain how far my coin will last. Maddie is more worried about provisions - food has proven a challenge, as the scouts find they must range farther and farther from camp for game. This has worried Rolfe, though he has not said why. He is often at the perimeter, staring into the woods.\n\nMore curiously, Maddie claims she has seen such marks before, on smaller spheres being sold at the outposts. She said the small spheres were scavenged from hunters near the Temple to the East. Rolfe frowned at that and said it wasn't in the ground they found the spheres, but in the rib cages of skeletons there, like stone hearts. Maddie looked unsettled by the news, as did her men. I pressed Rolfe on this, but he refused to speak further. I must secure one of these spheres – after our work here, perhaps a trip to the Temple is in order.\n\nR. Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_06">An Unpleasant Find: Day 17</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_AnUnpleasantFind">An Unpleasant Find: Day 17</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AnUnpleasantFind">April 17. One of the hunters returned, not with game, but with a strange talisman of bone, etched with red markings – the red might have been blood, but its hue was strange and reminded me of autumn colors in a way I could not explain – touching it something red and wet, yet I could see no stain upon my hand. The sensation lingered for quite some time after, like an unpleasant aftertaste in my thoughts.\n\nWhen the hunter showed it to Rolfe, Rolfe's temper flared – he cursed the man and told him to cast it away – “it'll draw others,” he spat –“the Withered wear them around their neck like collars,” he claimed.\n\nI had no reason to doubt him, and his reaction was such I scrubbed my hand where I had touched the talisman until it was almost bloody... yet I could still feel it on my skin.\n\nR. Grenville</string>

<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_IllTidings">Ill Tidings: Torn Page</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_IllTidings">Grenville doesn't see it. I do. The Withered WILL be back for its fetish – we need to finish our work here and move on. Perhaps one we could handle, but when it comes, I do not think it will come alone – when they swarm, they're like locusts, consuming everything and everybody in their path.\n\nI feel they are watching us, but the why of it I don't know. Are they waiting to see what Grenville's efforts yield with the sphere? If so, that is a further cause for concern. If he unlocks their purpose - might they somehow make use of it? And to what end?\n\nRolfe</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_08">April Dig: Ledger</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_AprilDig">April Dig: Ledger</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AprilDig">...Grenville's like a horse with blinders, but an honest man and fair with the men - perhaps too fair at times. I don't know what he plans once we unearth this stubborn boulder, but the work is safer than spilling more blood for a drop of azoth.\n\nHis man, Rolfe, is a sharp but worrisome fellow, his brow seems to gain another furrow with each passing day. His eyes are always to the woods, and he jumps at every shadow and crack of a branch. Each day he presses Grenville for when we might move on. It is not robbers he fears, that much is certain.\n\nTimber and stone we have in plenty, it's game we need. And we'll need to see some coin from Grenville soon, or else the men's work will slow.\n\n-Maddie</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_09">Misfortune</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_Misfortune">Misfortune</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_Misfortune">April 19. I write this far from the excavation, yet I am alive and must recount what happened. Rolfe and I were the only ones I know who managed to escape. It was near dusk, Rolfe had sought me out – one of the guides had gone missing – not deserted, of that Rolfe was certain – it was something else.\n\nHis instincts proved true, for as dusk bled out, we heard a distant cry in the woods, then silence – then spotted shapes, hunched, moved amongst the trees. Rolfe became afraid, but to the man's credit, it did not stay his actions, and he pushed me to move. “Where there's one, there's at least two others you can't see,” he hissed to me, and fighting my hesitation, I left the equipment behind.\n\nCursed isle – these infernal things seek to drive us from knowledge at every turn!\n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_10">The Obelisks!</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_TheObelisks">The Obelisks!</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheObelisks">Whatever powers these obelisks hold, the ancients of Aeternum made use of them – or more likely, shaped them themselves... but to what purpose, I do not know.\n\nLife grows thickly about them, striking blue flowers unlike any I have seen on the isle - and even azoth-infused flora, which we gather carefully.\n\nRolfe seemed out of sorts, has been since the attack on the dig site. He was hunched to the ground at a stone's throw from the obelisk, staring at it as if listening to something, clutching the vial of azoth I'd paid him with... I had to address him twice before the fellow snapped out of it, still at a loss for words.\n\nAfter addressing him rather sharply... perhaps sharper than was merited... Rolfe said he felt the azoth... ‘sing' in the presence of the obelisk, and did not know what to make of it.\n\nWe shall continue our circuit of the ring of obelisks, then leave the central Spire for last.\n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_11">Growing Fears</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_GrowingFears">Growing Fears</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_GrowingFears">May 20. Rolfe again voiced his fears the azoth might awaken that which lies dormant on Aeternum.\n\nThe man is a fool, and has not the heart to continue. I reminded him of the great fields of life that blossomed around the obelisks – if that was their power while the obelisks slept, what life might rise should they awake and how could that be naught but a good thing? Do we ourselves not awake each day and are better than when we sleep and know nothing but dreams?\n\nEven my reasoned arguments did not quell the man's doubt. He became quite animated, saying I knew not what might wake at the center Spire... even the dead, the skeletons that encircled the cursed temple might come alive, if their hearts were tied to this land.\n\nI suspect our ways must soon part, though I know his promise of payment keeps him in my shadow for now. If needs must, I will send him away, but before he goes, I will need his azoth for what I plan next. I will unlock the mysteries here, and cast such a light that it will burn away doubts and shadow from fearful minds.\n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_12">The Spire</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_TheSpire">The Spire</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheSpire">I take no pride in what happened next but do not take this as a writ of confession. Rolfe refused me, and would not part with the azoth he carried. I explained to him, at length, that I was certain of my discovery but lacked the means to test it with the central obelisk, but with his cooperation, we might yet illuminate the secrets of the culture that had come before us.\n\nHe grew agitated and said that he would leave at dawn and head back to the Renee's home and seek shelter with the Frenchwoman – and take the azoth with him. He spoke of nameless dangers if I persisted in my efforts, until I grew quite tired of it, and told him I wished to hear no more.\n\nAt this point, I ordered him to part with the azoth one last time. He shook his head, and before he could give voice his refusal, I had sunk my knife into his throat. I knew it would not kill him, but I had no use for his body any longer – it was what he carried I needed. If he wanted to go, then so be it. His other belongings would remain should he brave the journey again. I took solely the azoth, and I made a promise that should our paths cross, I would repay him for its use – if Aeternum let him awake as it did for others.\n\nI have one attempt at this – and I shall do so at the central Spire.\n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_13">The Great Work</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_TheGreatWork">The Great Work</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_TheGreatWork">[Page is partially burned] ...seems Rolfe spoke true – the azoth takes on a light in proximity to the obelisk, and I can see a tracery of light where none existed before. And the sound – like a roar, the closer one comes to the stone, as if something caged, waiting to be released.\n\nMy path seems clear... if these markings are touched with azoth, then perhaps the obelisk shall reveal its secrets and we will see what lies within. And should my findings prove...\n\n[page is burned, illegible]</string>
<string key="06_Arch_01_14">Azure Flames</string>
<string key="Lore_Title_Arch_AzureFlames">Azure Flames</string>
<string key="Lore_Body_Arch_AzureFlames">[Page is burned, but it looks like it was written on after it was burnt, not before.]\n\nMy hands shake as I write this. I was a fool. First the Spire, the great light... the light grew above me like the dawn of a second day, and my heart lept with hope – and again, when I saw the torches along the main road blossom into blue flame. It was as if I'd awoken the isle itself!\n\nThen... then a terrible silence from the Spire as the light streaming from it froze in the air, as if paralyzed by touching the Earth. I confess... I was consumed by a growing dread, and I fled along the road, the blue flames leading my steps... as it turned out, here, to the Temple Ruins from before.\n\nThe Temple was no sanctuary. Had the azure flames summoned me here? Whatever occurred at the Spire, it had touched here as well, awakening something terrible. I saw the same blue fire that lit the lanterns of the road now burn within the chest of the skeletal figures I had taken for dead... they were not dead, I see now, merely sleeping. Now they walked, blades drawn, circling the Temple with dark intent. What have I awoken?\n\nMay the powers of Aeternum have mercy upon my soul.\n\n-Grenville</string>

<string key="Grenville_Chapter_02">Grenville and the Temple</string>
<string key="Grenville_Title_02_01">Circle of Dead</string>
<string key="Grenville_Subtitle_02_01">Another macabre mystery</string>
<string key="Grenville_Body_02_01">Maddie's council proved true, even if she is no longer with us. We came to the Temple Ruins late in the day, although Rolfe was silent for the journey. I have left him to his thoughts, and left the attack at the Dig Site behind us as best I can.\n\nThere are an unusual number of the dead surrounding the ruins here – some lie on the ground, as if they collapsed where they stood, some still remain standing, blades in hand, as if they were slain in a single, frozen moment. The armor and weapons have markings like that on the Ancient structures on the isle. Are these the ancient colonists - or merely their servants – or soldiers? \n\nEvery skeleton is intact – no sign of broken bones, merely the flesh eaten down to the white… no insects, no spiders, nothing crawls upon them, and what caused them to remain standing, I do not know. Perhaps it was part of the power that keeps some of us deathless upon the isle? \n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="Grenville_Title_02_02">Keepers</string>
<string key="Grenville_Subtitle_02_02">Circles within circles</string>
<string key="Grenville_Body_02_02">Maddie's words again proved true – the skeletons on the outskirts of the structure have small spheres, with markings much like the Great Spheres, embedded in their chests. They were not posed as warnings – they seemed to have lived once, and I could see the trails they had worn in the stone and the temple perimeter, as if they had walked a circle about it countless times… yet simply one day, stopped. I took one of the spheres for study. \n\nTomorrow, Rolfe – if he will come, fear is continually evident on his face – and I will press on into the temple proper.\n\n-Grenville</string>
<string key="Grenville_Title_02_03">Of Statuary and Symbolism</string>
<string key="Grenville_Subtitle_02_03">Found in Amrine Temple</string>
<string key="Grenville_Body_02_03">The statues within the temple were strange, indeed, yet were clearly of the culture that came before… yet the likeness was peculiar, each statue bearing a twin pair of arms, and cleft down the middle much like the spheres great and small. A division of the self, a representation of duality, perhaps? In one of the statue's hands was a weapon, the other a familiar orb, outstretched – perhaps it was a religious symbol. Or something to channel other forces perhaps?\n\nI found another skeleton, intact, but with a spear and armor, unlike the ones on the perimeter outside. A leader or ruler, perhaps? It had not been buried, it seemed more a guard of the stone coffer within the temple.\n\n-G</string>
<string key="Grenville_Title_02_04">Ghosts</string>
<string key="Grenville_Subtitle_02_04">Spectres of the past or omens of the future? Both, perhaps.</string>
<string key="Grenville_Body_02_04">We could not move the great stone from the coffer, so I continued my examination of the statues. \n\nRolfe urged me to make haste, but night came swiftly upon us… as we sought to leave, we saw shapes in the darkness, white light among the trees, humans but drifting across the ground. Rolfe said we must not leave… the temple might be dangerous, but what wandered in the dark outside was far more dangerous. \n\nAnd so we waited the night, neither of us sleeping – just when we thought the night had become safe and still, another ghostlit figure would float from beyond the trees, as if reminding us they were never far and they would never leave as long as night was upon the temple.\n\nMay we make it through the night, we will leave this place, head to the great obelisks to the West, perhaps. The skeletons around the perimeter and inside the temple – I should have heeded the warning. At least they have not arisen as the wraiths have, they remain still at their posts, else these would be my last words.\n\n-G</string>

I tried to get into the inner sanctum of the temple, but more and more of those unliving things kept appearing.\n\nAs soon as I'd dealt with one, the last one had already risen again! I had to retreat, else I'd risk being stuck here, clawing my way out over a dozen or more deaths and rebirths.\n\nIt may take an army to clear these things out... Maybe drag all of their bones into a deep, dark hole and throw them inside.</string>

We were able to fight them back for now, but it's too late to press on to the settlement tonight, and we'll need the light to see what kind of damage the wagons have taken.\n\nThe differences in these last two trips has been night and day. Our last trip down into Windsward, perfect weather, no problems at all, and even shaved time off by taking a shortcut between two of those strange Corrupted pillars that have started to appear. This trip, however, has been one problem after another! Broken axles, spoiled food, attacks by every blasted creature on the island... it's like we're attracting every bit of bad luck possible. Perhaps we used up whatever luck we had left?\n\nAh well. We're safe enough for now, and on first look, it seems we only lost a bit of the trade goods.

Approximately the size of my palm, give or take, they are light but incredibly strong. It is unclear what they may have been used for, but given the tool marks on the edges, these may have been common to the Ancients. They could have even been decoration on something that has long since been lost to time, or common tools, or have any number of other uses.</string>

Until then, there's more work to do.

I'll make them see that we can survive without their silly little rules.\nWe've found plenty of stone nearby, and I'm certain it is the same kind that Father's huntsman used to start fires in the wild... but we've had no luck so far.

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_06_02">I just heard about the Dawes boy and his friends. Ghastly.\nWounds may be healed and your soul may be restored here in Aeternum... but that doesn't do a lot of good when you're torn apart by wolves. I heard they didn't even have a fire going in the evenings to keep the wildlife away — what, did they think they didn't need it here, that they were safe?\nI hear tell that the Magistrate even tried to bring them into the settlement and help them, but they refused, said they didn't need a handout from "commoners". Spoiled brats. Vanity is what got them killed, and I'll not feel bad for saying it.\n \nCan you bring some carrots the next time you come out this way? Mine don't seem to be taking to the ground properly.</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_07_01">Found in Hecker's Haven</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_07_01">A bunch of the boys brought me a right interesting one today, some missus just strolling into the camp like she owned the place.\nThey tried to rough her up a bit, find out what she'd fetch, but she cut two of them down without batting an eye. Then she asked for me, by name. Never met her before, but she sure know'd a lot about me. Told me she was looking for strong captains and crews to join her... didn't really say what for. But she's got a fire, that one.\nHave to talk it over with the men, but... I'm inclined to take this Isabella up on her offer.</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Title_07_02">Northward Bound</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_07_02">Found in Hecker's Haven</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_07_02">Since she arrived, I've been more and more impressed by Isabella. Whoever her master may be, they know a lot about this damned island. That idea to take people out and drown them near the storm line... whew! That's done more to keep the crew in line than any beatings or exile have. This island cuts out the threats of execution, so a good Captain has to be creative.\nShe's invited all of us to come north with her toward the Shattered Mountain, and is somehow guaranteeing our safety.\nFrom all she's told me... I want to believe her. This place is dangerous, even with a staunch crew at your back. Allies are our only hope.\nI'll tell the men tomorrow.</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Title_07_03">Whispers of Mutiny</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_07_03">Found in Pride of Puckett</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_07_03">Captain says we should join up with this Isabella, the sassy one who cut down Hans and the Bosun. Sure, they came back right quick, but weren't happy with it. And after what happened next, not sure I am, either.\nShe's a looker, for sure, and fights like three men... but something seems a touch off about her. Can't put my finger on it, but when she was looking over the men, she had this look... only time I'd seen it before was on a man's face after a week without food, about to get a bite of gruel.\nShe looked at me. Felt like my head was in a vice, or I'd just had a fifth of the Captain's private stock. She looked away, and it was gone.\nIf the Captain decides to go along with this, I might just try and slip away... see how many others want to tag along. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll have to take matters into my own hands.</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Title_07_04">A Cautionary Tale</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_07_04">Found in Pride of Puckett</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_07_04">Not sure I should be writing this, after what happened to Salvatore. The Captain caught wind of a mutiny, from Sal and some others, and Isabella gave him some new ideas on punishment.\nHe took five of them and stuffed them in barrels, then hauled them out past the breakers... as far out as he could get. Cracked a hole in each barrel, then kicked them overboard. From what that Isabella has said, it was far enough out that when they come back, they're likely to be Drowned... which is a fate that no sailor wants. Everyone's scared, not just of her, but of the hold she has on the Captain.\nNow I see why Sal was so desperate to either escape or take over. I only hope I'm not next, after writing this down.</string>

Most anything of value was taken a long time ago, and what's left ain't worth the effort.\nBut the boss is paying, so we goes where he goes. If he wants to sit on old stones and look at ants, or twigs, or a tiny twist of metal... as long as his coin's good, me and the boys'll stick by him.\nJust hope he don't want us to go make friendly with them pirates.</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_08_02">Found in Breakwater Bulwark</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_08_02">I've reached the top of the bluffs, and set a small camp overlooking the breakwater. Windy, but an amazing view, and quite a charming locale — if you forget about the Pirates at the far side of the cove, or the bony undead Guardians that seem hell-bent on keeping interlopers away from any of the Ancients' ruins.\nI was lucky to have found this... whatever it is. A small stone orb, about half a hand wide, with a series of lines and symbols carved along the meridian. Can't be certain, but this may be the language of the Ancients! You would think, with all of these ruins scattered about, there would be more samples of writing to decipher, but... according to local scholars, very few examples have been found. Maybe we just haven't been looking hard enough.\nEither way. My collection will benefit from this find.</string>

<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_01">Mesdames, Messieurs – welcome. Though absent, I am your host - help yourself to the garden, and any of the livestock (if the ungrateful swine are still here), just kill them quick swiftly so they don't remember in the morning.\n\nIf you have chanced upon a rare creature, I'd ask you add a note in the log, for I have much curiosity regarding the creatures native to Aeternum – also, as a courtesy to your hostess, you leave the trophies I have gathered here out of respect, for I went to considerable effort for each, and each bears a tale.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_02">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_02">It is not the animals brought with us on La Renommée that interest me – nor the deer or wolf of the isle, though of great size and fierce disposition – it is the beasts native to Aeternum. I fear it would take a lifetime, perhaps several, to see them all - yet my curiosity will not let me remain idle. Even Jacques' memory has faded, washed away as he was in the storm – but perhaps that is for the best, for had he survived, life would have been quite different.\n\nI have been given a chance many would dream of - to explore this isle and see what flourishes here.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Title_01_03">Migration</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_03">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_03">The reason for the migration of animals and beasts is now clear to me – they are fleeing south, driven from the Great Cleave to the North. \n\nIf so, they may be a warning that the Corrupted may be massing for another foray into the Brightwood. This has swept away my desire for the hunt – if I remain overlong, it will be I who will be hunted, and I fear for my soul should those devils capture me and take me to the Shattered Mountain.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Title_01_04">A Death of Cold</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_04">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_04">I hunt bison in the area mostly for something to do – they roam thickly here and in Everfall, and the skins fetch a decent price in Windsward for those unwilling to do the labor. I've not had the same aversion to cold as other settlers – hunting near the mountains is peaceful to me. I had a small base camp at the mountain to the north along the trails but past this expedition I found little game as it went deeper into the snows and mountains than before.\n\nIt was there I came across the first bison corpse – killed by wolves it seemed at a glance, but upon inspection I saw that the wounds the bison bore were marks of teeth and claws much bigger than any wolf I had ever seen. Inspecting the corpse more carefully, I discovered the bison's mouth to be covered in ice, as if its breath had frozen before it was torn apart. The icy tracks of the assailant led into the northern mountains.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Title_01_05">The New Predator</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_05">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_05">The tracks of the creature that killed the bison were that of a wolf – but not a pack of wolves, a single wolf. Yet, based on the snow, much heavier than any wolf – and embedded in the tracks were small, snapped twigs, and in one, what seemed to be part of a tree root, covered in the same frost as marked the bison's wounds.\n\nI consider myself no coward, but this isle's mysteries frighten me, for I do not know what the snows hide that stalks in the shape of a wolf and whose tracks are blended with that of the forest – but I do not wish to find out.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Title_01_06">Stag of the Forest</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_06">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_06">Yet as the bison seemed to thin in the passes and I became wary of the strange wolf tracks in the mountains, I found myself avoiding the mountain snows and instead, favoring hunts deeper into the woods. \n\nIt was on the hunt today that I first caught sight of the stag – not a stag as familiar to us, but something that seemed grown from the forest and had taken the shape of a stag – I know not how to explain it. Around its horns grew moss, flowers, and its hide was the rich green grass of the forest floor. The sight struck me so I could not move, I could not breathe, until the creature seemed to spot me, then leapt away and vanished into the undergrowth.\n\nNow every silhouette in the forest stands out starkly to me: the animals of the isle are not governed by the seasons, but shaped from them – the earth, the vegetation, even the snow and ice.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_07">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_07">I head to the great crater lake at first light – the journey will be long, but I think the leagues shall pass quickly. I have heard tales of the strange forest creatures there, seemingly woven from the wood itself – a trapper in the local outpost had given the creature a name, a ‘spriggan,' a tree spirit the height of four men, with a body and limbs of branches given life – is this something born of the isle? Or perhaps something created by the azoth in the forest?\n\nThis isle is filled with wonders, and I wish to see them all. May fortune favor me on my journey – a glimpse of such a sprite is all I require, even if I must spend weeks circling the lake.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Title_01_08">Chance Meeting</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_08">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_08">Chance meeting and odd meeting with someone I had nearly forgotten about – the gentleman scholar I had met the previous year, M. Grenville. The man seems struck by the same wanderlust as I, though his seems more in the way of digging up stones and picking at bricks in old ruins. I offered him and his companions shelter for the night, but though his companions seemed to want to rest, he seemed eager to be on his way and kept speaking of a Great Discovery that was within his reach, if his efforts proved true. \n\nHis manner – while not hostile, and I'm certain he meant no rudeness or insult by it – was rather unsettling, and seemed to have an urgency about him – not of one fleeing something, but chasing something. \n\nIn an attempt to calm him, I asked if he still played his piano, and he seemed confused for a moment, as if he had quite forgotten it existed, then shook his head, as if the memory was unwelcome, a distraction. I hope he finds what he seeks, though I fear what he might stir up in the Brightwood if he does not take care to slow his pace.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

<string key="HuntersCabin_Subtitle_01_09">Renée's Journal</string>
<string key="HuntersCabin_Body_01_09">I awoke to hear the cry of the animals – I heard them making cries in the middle of the night, and blue fires on the roads from lanterns that had been dark for as long as I have been upon the isle. Behind it all, there was a roar that rose in waves, then faded - and a great frozen light from the great rock that sits in the center of the stone ring. \n\nI fear what I shall find, but I will not wait for the tide to claim me without going to see with my own eyes what has happened. Is this the Great Discovery that Grenville spoke of? If so, I fear it has consumed him – and awoken something in the isle itself.\n\n- Renée Marie Cartier</string>

That blowhard Dauti sits in the tavern all day, crafting stories of my cowardice to anyone who'll listen.\n\nAt first, I dismissed his falsehoods, believing the people of Windsward would surely be able to see through the lies, but then I heard others repeating his fishwives' tales, and I had a moment of doubt. Was it cowardice that motivated me to abandon the Mines De Miclot to the Lost? Have we let the Lost Pirates on the coast grow too strong for us to ever be able to contain them?\n\nMaybe Dauti is right. I don't know anymore. I've decided to resign as Constable and leave Windsward. I'll visit my cousin in First Light and then return to Ebonscale to see if I can be any use there in strengthening the resistance to the Empress, as I have heard her ambitions have taken a dark turn.\n\nI'll send you this only after I've gone, because I won't allow you to convince me to stay again, and as much as I will miss you, I would ask you not to come after me.\n\nYou must stay in Windsward. If that bastard Dauti becomes Constable, as I expect, then the settlement will need you. Your patience, your optimism… they've been my strength. I thank you for that and hope we may meet again.

I've come to suspect the rest of these fools have fallen victim to some strange mental illness. Cowards, the lot of them!\n\nI have yet to share this suspicion with anyone else, but I'm wondering if it isn't something in the fowl. I've heard rumors that sometimes, when people come back to life, they take on the traits of any creatures killed nearby. The turkeys may actually be affecting the populace! I swear I saw a turkey feather in Korrapati's hair the other day. When I looked again, it was gone. And honestly, the whole settlement smells like turkey!\n\nI know what they'd say if I tried to tell them. 'That Dauti, such an imagination when he's in his cups', they'd say. Changying used to say it all the time. What's a Constable got to do to get some respect around here?\n\nI'll say this much, if Windward becomes threatened by the Lost or the Corrupted, we're going to need help, from strangers, from other settlements, wherever we can get it.\n\nFor the moment, at least, I'm headed back to the tavern for a glass of ale and a laugh, but no more goddamned turkey legs for me.\n\nDauti</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_01">My kingdom for a crone’s tinctures to cure this demoniacal sneezing!\n\nYet and still, it is impossible to maintain a sour countenance in this verdant wonder. I was even able to barter for a new inkhorn and quills.\n\nCome to think on it, literacy and letter writing are surprisingly common on this strange island. I suppose that is logical. We have nothing but time, why not learn letters from a fellow. In a closed system like this, literacy spreads. Language as pathogen, though a most delightful contagion, I dare say.\n\nArriving in town, I found a proper place to wash the road dust from my throat. My smiling fancy occasioned me to whistle. Instantly, a gnarled oak of a man stood at my side, saying, “Enjoy your drink stranger, but best not be whistling, singing, nor dancing.”\n\nAt first, I thought myself the butt of some provincial jest. How positively Calvinistic! However, given the graveness of his continence and immense size of his oaken knuckles, I thought it politic to acquiesce. Everyone in the room was merry enough, but there was no music or singing. Conversation was kept to a low murmur.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_02">I am not adventurous. Dusty tombs might draw the likes of Grenville, but not I. My scholastic investigations occur through books and interviews. I desire to piece together the folktales and culture bubbling in the unique pot of this island.\n\nTo that end, I found the man with the oaken knuckles – his name is Zadok – and I plied him with libations and many games of draughts. Though his words slurred by the time he opened up to me, his pickled tongue hinted at intriguing tidbits indeed.\n\nHe spoke of a dancing plague, a contagious compulsion to gyrate night and day. He spoke of a spreading pandemic and people dancing until literal death.\n\nHe fell asleep before divulging more. What a delightfully bizarre notion. A dancing plague!\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

Later in the evening, I repeated my stratagem of carousing, but with diminishing returns. Filled to the brim, I stepped outside to pass water. Suddenly, a great ogre of a man accosted me in an alley, backing me up against a wall. His breath reeked of spirits and wormwood. I thought the brute was about to offer me personal violence.\n\nInstead, he whispered, “Have you heard His music? Have you seen the Emerald King?”\n\nBefore I could do anything but stammer, the giant lumbered off towards the woods, with a giggle that sounded too childish for his titanic frame.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_15_04">A page from the journal of Ichabod Shaw</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_04">Days of interviewing the locals and dozens more games of draughts with Zadok have reaped some reward. This Dancing Plague, if it happened at all, happened long ago. Time is a tricky thing to track here. The details vary from mouth to mouth. All agree that a great many died. Some even suggest their exhausted bodies died permanently.\n\nSome think the plague a punishment. These fertile lands saw endless war and strife by those who wished to control it. It is thought the land eventually had enough.\n\nThis is all connected to a very loose myth cycle of a figure known as the King in Emerald, also called the Verdant Death and the Music that Eats. Opinions vary whether this is meant to be an actual entity or simply the madness of the dancing given allegorical form, a shape seen in the delirious ecstasy.\n\nOnly a portion of the community believe in any of this, and they think we should enjoy the bounty of the land very quietly.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_15_05">A page from the journal of Ichabod Shaw</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_05">Zadok shewed me something interesting today. He took me outside the settlement to the edge of the woods. A woman and two men danced. Their faces betrayed absolutely no awareness of their surroundings, even when I shouted to them. I gather that he and other believers moved the dancers away from the populace, to avoid contagion.\n\nI tried to approach the dancers, but he stopped me with a vice grip on my arm. He told me of a book he once saw, written entirely on the subject of the King in Emerald. He only said this to lure me away from the dancers. It worked.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_06">I must find this book! I have so many questions. Did the dancing plague happen? If so, what caused it? Mass hysteria? Ergot poisoning? An actual preternatural agent?\n\nWhat had I witnessed in the forest? Were these contained cases of the surviving plague? Simply more hysteria fed by old stories?\n\nI am for some reason reminded of a particular species of ant that often falls prey to a more particular species of fungi. The spores bewitch the ant’s mind and put its body under the power and ineffable motives of the fungus.\n\nI must find this book.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_07">I dreamed. I saw a figure resplendent in green. I could not bear to look at it directly. With a knife, I modified my vocal organ to better sing.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw\n\nSupplemental – I awoke this morning to see the above written in my journal. Though it is my handwriting, I recollect neither the writing of it nor the dream it implies. Curious.</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_08">Eureka, I have done it! I have acquired the book. I do not feel proud of the method. It was certainly not in my normal character. Nevertheless, I have much reading to do.\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_15_09">A page from the journal of Ichabod Shaw</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_09">Nearly finished with my reading. I could no longer focus on the words today. I decided a walk was in order. I find myself rambling by the edge of the woods. I hum a tune and if I harmonize it just right, I can very nearly hear a distant music. Like the sea in a shell. There’s a cadence there…\n\n-Ichabod Shaw</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_15_10">My eyesight is poor in the dark. I did not wish to come here, but my Judas legs brought me all the same. Humming. I can nearly hear it! I cannot keep from swaying. I will just leave my journal here, at the edge of the woods, just for a bit. Maybe I will see Him.\n\nIf I hum, I can hear the words. The cadence births verses in my mouth.</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_16_01">Harken and beware. When the earth’s thirst is quenched with blood beware. The Ancients came and went. What is time in this place? The land was green and good, and others came. Plenty for all, yet they fought as if caught in the jaws of scarcity.\n\nGlutted on gore, the earth vomited corpses when the great rains came. Eventually, this land had had enough.</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Title_16_02">The Music of the Green</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_16_02">Pages from the book The King in Emerald</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_16_02">It began as a shift in the air. The murmur of trees. The crackling whisper of crops conspiring in the night. The music of the green.\n\nThe warmongers felt this change, invisible yet heady. Peace and joy grew root-bound in their hearts, driving out all aggression. Warring faction met and reveled. They drank, they ate, they sang.\n\nAnd they danced. They danced day and night. They smiled and danced upon bloody feet. They danced into ecstatic delirium, until they saw the face of god.\n\nThen was acknowledged the presence of the King in Emerald. The Verdant Death! The Music that Eats! He had come, not as a thief in the night, but in motley of glory green.\n\nOne by one, the dancers died. Then their corpses danced a while longer. They danced until their souls guttered out like worm-eaten stars, until they could never return to life again.\n\nWhen the last reveler rotted away, the King in Emerald held court. He holds court still.</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Subtitle_16_03">Pages from the book The King in Emerald</string>
<string key="06_Windsward_Body_16_03">Fools ignore these warnings, and the wise enjoy this land in quiet. We reap its bounty with respect. We avoid the clang and clamor of battle. We do not sing. We do not dance. We dare not even whistle.\nTo be loud is to kick up his attention, like stomping through pollen-engorged flowers. Every noise echoes back a fragment of His melody. Then his words find you. Once the earworm digs, there is no stopping it. Once you dance, there is no escaping that grinning oblivion.\n\nHave you heard His music?\n\nHave you seen the Emerald King?</string>

<string key="06_Windsward_Body_17_01">Grub,\nHave you marked not the night of the year? The Wild Hunt is upon us! On this night, the fearful flock hide in their beds. Those who fancy themselves hardened make excuses to stay in and have another round. But we brave few venture out.\n\nYou know the spot, the Goblin Run. At the witch’s hour, we sprint from one clearing to the next, a flight through thorny forest between. If we’re fast enough, we make it to the other side. If we’re lucky enough, we might catch a glimpse of the Horned One. One of us never comes out the other side.\n\nThe gang and I will be there. Your presence earns you a better name. Your absence proves your cowardice. Remember, you don’t have to be the fastest, you just can’t be the slowest.\n\n-Zal</string>
