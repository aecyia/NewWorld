<string key="Memorials_Body_01_01">The soul is a mysterious thing both on and off Aeternum. \n\nBut even before we came to this strange island, death vexed us with the loss of your mother in the Old World. \n\nLaura Marie Charron— a woman who went out of her way to better everyone’s day with joy and love. Selfless, radiant, and fearless. It is for her that I dedicate this to writing: that our souls are forever intertwined. \n\nAdam and Archer, it is my hope you find soulmates as kind and patient with you as your mother was with me. I know out there for you there is a twin flame whose heart burns with the same passion yours does. \n\nYour mother and I, with the time we were allowed, created two perfect examples of our love: you. Her love for you was beyond the confines of this world and that love lives on in us. Eternal life isn’t limited to what we see here in Aeternum—it is in our very hearts. \n\nLaura, as you were in life, I know you are always with Adam, Archer, and I. The boys and I will come here to remember you and all you did for us, and all your memory continues to do.  Until we are together again in Paradise, my heart is here with you my love. \n\nLet this place be blessed as a sanctuary for all who have lost, and all who wish to remember those who came before them.\n\nHonor her shrine, hear her voice, and feel her here with us.</string>
