<string key="TheThingInTheSwamp_Body_01_01">More sightings of the thing today. Always in the swamps. What’s going on out there?\n\nSpoke with the blacksmith today. Says the thing is like a patch of peat moss ambulating like a man.\n\nSpoke to a traveling merchant today. Says the thing is like a bog body, pickled and preserved, bleeding water the color of strong tea.\n\nSpoke with Seamus today. Said he mistook the thing for his pa, but it turned out to be all worms, a writhing mass contriving into a squelchy fellowship to move as we move?\n\nMore talk of the thing today. Community will be in an uproar more damaging than any creature. Going out there to investigate, out into the swamps. Will record findings here, when I return.\n</string>
